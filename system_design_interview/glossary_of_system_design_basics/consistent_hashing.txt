Consistent Hashing


Data partitioning - distributing data across a set of servers. Improves scalability and performance.
    But..
        How do we know on which node a particular piece of data will be stored?
        When we add ore remove nodes, how do we know what data will be moved from existing nodes to new nodes? How can we minimize movements here?

Data replication - making copies of data and storing on different servers. Improves availability and durability 


Consistent hashing maps data to physical nodes and ensures only a small set of keys move when servers are added or removed.
    Each node in the ring is assigned a range of data.


Virtual nodes assist when a physical nodes "dies" or needs to be decommissioned. 
    In short, a physical node's range is divided into small ranges and each physical node is assigned several of these smaller ranges. See vnode screenshot in this directory for a visual.

    This spreads the laod more evenly across the physical nodes. Furthermore, when a node needs to be rebuilt, many nodes participate in the rebuild process so it's not all on one.




This one was admittedly really convoluted to read.
