Indexes

There always comes a time when database performance is no longer satisfactory. First thing to turn to: database indexing. 

Goal of creating an index is to make it faster to search through a table and find the row or rows that you want. 
Indexes can be created using one or more columns in a database table.

Example: A Library Catalog - Usually, two such catalogs: one sorted by book title, the other by author. So, you can search for a specific book or a specific person.

Indexing can decrease write performance for this reason. Write data AND update index every time - increased number of operations. All insert, update, and delete operations are affected. So, only add indexes when necessary, since the point is to increase retrieval performance.
