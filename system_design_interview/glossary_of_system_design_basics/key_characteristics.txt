Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems

Scalability 

-capability of a system, process or network to grow and manage increased demand. if it can evolve to do so, it can scale
-horizontal vs. vertical:
    -horizontal means adding more of the thing in question to your pool of resources
    -vertical means increasing the power of the resources you already have


Reliability 

-ability of a system to continue operating correctly in the presence of faults, errors, failures
-a distributed system is reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its software or hardware components fail
-exmaple course has is of Amazon - if a server containing your cart fails, it is immediately replaced with another that has an identical copy of your cart due to redundancy of components and data. obviously, this comes at a cost.


Reliability vs. Fault Tolerance

-reliability is user-centric - can the system consistently meet the user's expectations over time?
    -measured in terms of error rates, mean time between failures (MTBF)
-fault tolerance is system-centric - how does the system handle internal failures?
    -measured in how quickly and effectively a system detects, isolates and recovers from failures


Availability 

-% of time that a system remains operational under normal conditions
-takes into account maintainability, repair time
-reliability = availability over time


Serviceability/Manageability, Efficiency also called out in this section but are self explanatory.
