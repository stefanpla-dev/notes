Proxies

Definition:
    An intermediate piece of hard/software that sits between the client and the server. Can be used to cache data, load balance, route requests, or introduce an additional layer of security. 

Can anonymize the client from the server by facilitating requests for resources from other servers on behalf of clients. This is called a forward proxy.

Can also anonymize the server from the client. This is called a reverse proxy.
