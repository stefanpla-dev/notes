Long-Polling vs WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events

These are all communication protocols between a client and a server.

Ajax Polling
    Client opens connection and requests data.
    Webpage reads and sends requests to the server at regular intervals
    Server sends back
    Client requests again if needed

    Client has to keep asking for new data and many empty repsonses are returned as a result.

HTTP Long-Polling
    Allows server to push information to a client whenever new data is available.
    Client can still request, but with understanding that it may not get a response immediately. "Hanging GET"
    Once data is available, it is sent to the client.

WebSockets
    Establishes a persistent connection between a client and a server that both parties can use to start sending data at any time.

Server-Sent Events (SSEs)
    Client makes initial request 
    Webpage opens a connection to the server
    Server then sends data whenever it is available. Client can't make additional asks.

    Best when real-time traffic from the server is needed or data from the server is generated in a loop.
