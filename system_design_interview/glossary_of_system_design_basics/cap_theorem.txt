CAP Theorem

Definition: 
    The theorem can be easily stated as: in the presnece of a network partition, a distributed system must choose either consistency or availability.

States that it is impossible for a distributed system to accomplish all of the following:

    Consistency: All nodes see the same data at the same time.

    Availability: Every reqyest received by a non-failing node must result in a response. Ability to remain accessible even if one or more nodes go down.

    Partition tolerance: Communication break between any two nodes in the system. Partition tolerant system continues to operate even if there are partitions in the system. 


CA, CP, and AP are the options, given the theorem. However, CA is not really a coherent system, as a system that isn't partition tolerant will be forced to give up either consistency or availability in the case of a network partition
