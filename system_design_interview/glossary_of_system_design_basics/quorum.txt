Quorum

Once a system decides to maintain multiple copies of data, how do they ensure the copies are consistent and that all clients see the same view of the data?

Definition: 
    A quorum is the minimum number of servers on which a distributed operation needs to be performed successfully before declaring the operation's overall success. Usually a simple majority where it is recommended to always have an odd number of total nodes in a cluster.


Quorum is achieved when nodes follow the protocol R+W > N, where
R = minimum read nodes
W = minimum write nodes
N = nodes in the quorum group
Best throughput/availability achieved when 1 < r < w < n, because reads are more frequent than writes in most applications.


Advantages to Quorum:
    Fault tolerance: allows system to tolerate a certain number of failures
    Consistency: Helps maintain data consistency across nodes
    Availability: increases availability of the system by allowing operations to proceed as long as quorum is met 

Challenges to Quorum:
    Network Partitions: in cases of network failures, forming a quorum might be challenging
    Performance Overhead: in large clusters can introduce latency in decision-making processes
    Complexity: frequent node or network changes makes this inherently more challenging
