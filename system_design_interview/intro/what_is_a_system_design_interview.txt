What is IS:

    -part of hiring process for software engineers, system architects, devops engineers
    -open ended by nature. a typical technical interview may have a specific solution to get to. this isn't like that.
    -goal is to evaluate how you think through large-scale problems and make engineering decisions.

Why does it exist?

    -forces you to break an open ended problem down and work towards a solution.
    -though not a coding challenge, it still evaluates your technical knowledge of things like system architecture components
        -APIs, caching, load balancing (lol) 
    -how do you account for things like scalability, reliability, maintainability
    -trade-off analysis : be ready to justify WHY you make the decisions that you do. 
    -demonstrates communication ability. they are inherently collaborative

What it is not

    -getting a perfect answer. rarely is there one "correct" answer.
    -a test of memorization.
