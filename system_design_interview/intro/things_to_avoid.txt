What NOT To Do:

    -Ignore the requirements or oversimplify!
    -Lose sight of the big picture. Don't zoom in on small details too soon, if at all
    -Stick rigidly to one idea. Be flexible. The interviewer may give you hints!
    -Overlook trade offs. Be prepared to justify one approach compared to another.
    -Overlook non-functional requirements
    -under-communication
    -over-confidence
    -monologuing
    -not acknowledging what you don't know
