Serverless Architecture vs Traditional Server-Based Architecture

Two different approaches to deploying and managing applications/services, especially in the world of cloud computing.

SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE 

    Definition: Cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. Developers write and deploy code without worrying about the unerlying infrastructure.

    Automatically scales up or down based on demand and costs are based on actual usage.

    Ideal for applications with variable or unpredictable workloads.

    PROS:
        Eliminates need for managing servers
        Pay only for what you use, which can reduce costs
        Automatically scales with application load.
    CONS:
        Less control over the environment and underlying infrastructure.
        Can experience latency issues

TRADITIONAL SERVER-BASED ARCHITECTURE 

    Definition: Applications are deployed on servers which must be provisioned, maintained, and scaled by a developer or operations team. Servers have fixed resources, run continuously, and incur ongoing costs regardless of usage.

    PROS:
        Complete control over the server environment and infrastructure.
        More flexibility in configuring and optimizing the server
    CONS:
        Higher costs
        Additional operational complexity.
