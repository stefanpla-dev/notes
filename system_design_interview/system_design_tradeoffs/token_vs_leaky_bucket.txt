Toekn Bucket vs Leaky Bucket

Two algorithms used for network traffic shaping and rate limiting.

TOKEN BUCKET ALGORITHM 

    Mechanism: Based on tokens added to a bucket at a fixed rate. Each token represents permission to send a certain amount of data. When data needs to be sent, it can only be transmitted if there is a token available, which is then removed from the bucket. Bucket can store tokens which allows for temporary bursts of data at moments of high traffic.

    Think video streaming service. Service allows data burts for fast initial buffering. Once tokens are used up, the streaming rate is limited to the rate of replenishment.

    PROS:
        Flexibility in handling moments of high traffic
    CONS:
        Requires monitoring the number of available tokens.

LEAKY BUCKET ALGORITHM

    Mechanism: Packets are added to a queue and then released at a constant rate. If bucket is full, incoming packets are discarded or queued for later transmission.

    PROS:
        Simple to implement
        Ensures uniform output rate
    CONS:
        Does not allow for much flexibility in handling traffic bursts
        Can lead to packet loss
