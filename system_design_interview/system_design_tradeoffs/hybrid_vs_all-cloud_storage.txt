Hybrid Cloud Storage vs. All-Cloud Storage

Two cloud computing models that businesses use for storing data, each with its own architecture and use cases.

HYBRID CLOUD STORAGE 

    Definition: Combines private and public cloud storage. Data and applications can move between the two. Usually, more sensitive data is stored on a private cloud or on premises, usually in cases where compliance is critical.

    PROS: 
        Enhanced security 
        Easy to scale resources up or down via the public cloud component
    CONS:
        Management of two different environments.
        Can be more expensive than using only public cloud services

ALL-CLOUD STORAGE 

    Definition: Pretty self-explanatory, given the above. Cloud services utilized to make this possible are typically AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.

    PROS:
        Low maintenance
        Easy to scale resources to meet demand
    CONS:
        Potential security concerns
        Fully reliant on internet connectivity
        Fully reliant on a third party
