Server-Side Caching vs Client-Side Caching

Two strategies to store data temporarily to improve the performance and efficiency of applications. Both reduce load times and bandwidth usage but operate at different points in the process.

SERVER-SIDE CACHING 

    Definition: Server maintains cache to store frequently accessed data. It is fully controlled by the server. Can include database query caching, full HTML page caching, and object caching.

    Ideal for data used by multiple users.

    PROS: 
        Faster response times
        Decreased server load
        Can centrally manage data freshness
    CONS:
        Requires additional server resources like memory, disk space
        Requires effective cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency

CLIENT-SIDE CACHING

    Definition: Data is stored on client's device, like a web browser or a mobile app. Can load data without sending a request to the server. Controlled by the client. Includes browser caching of images, scripts, stylesheets, and application data.

    Ideal for user-specific data.

    PROS:
        Reduced network traffic
        Allows users to access cached data even when offline.
    CONS:
        Storage limited to the client device's storage capacity
        Can lead to users viewing outdated info if not synced properly with the server
