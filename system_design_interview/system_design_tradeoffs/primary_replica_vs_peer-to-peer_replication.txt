Primary-Replica vs Peer-to-Peer Replication

PRIMARY-REPLICA   

    Definition: One server handles all of the write operations and then the changes are replicated to one or more servers.

    Characteristics: 
        Unidirectional (all data flows from the primary to the replicas)
        Read/write split (primary handles all writes, while replicas handle all reads)

        Ideal for applications where read-heavy operations need to be scaled.
    
    PROS:
        Easier to maintain and ensure Consistency
        Can scale read operations by adding replicas
    CONS:
        Single point of failure
        Changes made to the primary take time to propogate.

PEER-TO-PEER REPLICATION 

    Definition: Each node in a network can act both as a client and a server. Nodes are equally able to initiate or complete replication processes.

    Characteristics:
        Multi-directional (any node can replicate data to another node)
        Autonomy (each peer maintains its copy of the data and can independently respond to read and write requests)

        Ideal for distributed networks where decentralization and load distribution are critical, like file sharing or blockchain technologies.

    PROS:
        Eliminates single point of failure
        Better load balancing
    CONS: 
        More complex to manage and ensure data consistency across nodes
        Handling data conflicts can be challenging due to simultaneous updates from multiple peers.
