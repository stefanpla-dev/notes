CDN Usage vs Direct Server Serving

Two different approaches to delivering content to end-users over the internet. CDN Usage is more likely to be utilized by a huge shop like Amazon. Direct Server Serving is more likely to be used by a local brick and mortar store for their website.

CDN USAGE 

    Definition: A Content Delivery Network is a network of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. CDNs cache content in multiple locations closer to end-users to reduce latency.

    PROS:
        Reduced latency
        Efficiently handles high traffic/easy to scale
        Reduces load on origin server
    CONS:
        Can incur additional costs
        Requires configuration and maintenance of CDN settings.

DIRECT SERVER SERVING 

    Definition: All user requests are handled directly by the main server where the site is hosted without intermediary CDN servers.

    PROS:
        Simple to set up and manage
        Cost effective for small scale
    CONS:
        Difficult to scale
        Users far from server location may experience slower access.
