Load Balancer vs API Gateway

Used to manage incoming traffic and requests to web applications. Some overlapping functionality, primary purposes and use cases are distinct.

LOAD BALANCER 

Purpose: distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers. MAximize resource use and throughput, reduce response time.

How it Works: Requests are routed to one of several backend servers based on factors like number of current connections, server response time, server health


API GATEWAY 

Purpose: Acts as a reverse proxy to route requests, aimplify the API, and aggregate the results from various ervices.

How it Works: handles request routing, API composition, rate limiting, authentication, authorization.

Usage: Think an online banking app that needs to interact with services like account details, transaction history, and currency exchange rates. API Gateway sits between the app and these services.


KEY DIFFERENCES

Load balancers ensure high availability and redundancy of servers. API Gateways are more about providing a central point for managing and routing API calls. Both can route requests, but the API Gateway offers more functionality.

These two can work well together, where the load balancer manages traffic across multiple instances of API Gateways. Can run a load balancer before, after, or before and after an API Gateway, depending on needs.
