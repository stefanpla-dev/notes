API Gateway vs Reverse Proxy

Both manage incoming requests, but serve different purposes and cater to different needs.

API GATEWAY (REVIEW)

    Purpose: Management tool that acts as a single point of entry for a defined group of microservices, handling and routing them to the appropriate service. Unified interface to a set of independently deployable services.

    Functionality: Routing, request aggregation, cross-cutting concerns (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, logging)

REVERSE PROZY (REVIEW)

    Purpose: Shield server from client, fetch resources from server on behalf of a client.

    Functionality: Load balancing, security, caching.

KEY DIFFERENCES

    Primary role - API gateway for managing application level traffic, reverse proxy more for security and caching

    Complexity - API gateways tend to be more sophisticated.
