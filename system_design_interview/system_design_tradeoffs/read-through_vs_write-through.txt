Read-Through vs Write-Through Caching

Relationship between the cache and the primary storage system.

READ-THROUGH 

Data is loaded into the cache on demand, typically when a read request occurs for data that is not already in the cache.
    - CONS: This first load will always follow a cache miss. Higher latency.
    - PROS: Application only needs interact with the cache.
            Frequently accessed data is served quickly.
            Reduces load on primary storage

Ideal for data that is read frequently but updated infrequently, or scenarios where you can tolerate eventual consistency for reads.


WRITE-THROUGH 

Data is written simultaneously to the cache and the primary storage system. This ensures the cache always contains the most recent data.
    - CONS: Latency on write operations
            Higher load on primary storage
    - PROS: Data consistency that read-through may lack
            No data loss if cache fails/crashes

Ideal for applications for which high integrity matters, especially for write operations, or when the system requires immediate propogation of updates.
