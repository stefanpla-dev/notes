SQL vs NoSQL

SQL (REVIEW)

    Relational databases. Use SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating data.

    Data is stored in tables which follow a schema, and those tables relate to one another.

    Best for applications that require complex, reliable transactions or where data structure won't change frequently


NoSQL (REVIEW)

    Non-relational or distributed databases. No fixed schema, which allows the data to change over time. Designed to horizontally scale using distributed clusters of hardware. 

    Can store different types of data without a fixed schema.

    Best for applications that handle large amounts of diverse data or projects where data structure can change over time.


KEY DIFFERENCES

    SQL offers strong ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
    NoSQL can be faster and less complex for certain types of queries.
