Data Compression vs Data Deduplication

Techniques to optimize data Storage

DATA COMPRESSION 

    Definition: Encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Removes redundancies and is often used to save storage space or decrease transmission times. Think zip files.

    Scope is a single file or data stream.

    Types:
        Lossless compression - these are zip files. You can restore data back to its original state. 
        Lossy compression - permanently eliminate certain information, especially in media files.

    PROS: 
        Efficient storage
        Reduces data transmission time over networks
    CONS:
        Requires computational resources for compressing and decompressing data.
        Quality loss in lossy compression can lead to degredation in media files.

DATA Deduplication

    Definition: Eliminate duplicate copies of repeating data. Used in data storage and backup systems to reduce the amount of storage space needed.

    May result in elimination of entirely redundant files or data blocks across a system. Scope is system-wide.

    Relies on references to the original data for restoration.

    Process:
        System identifies and removes redundant data segments, keeping only one copy of each.
        Subsequent copies are replaced with pointers to the stored segment.

    PROS:
        Significantly reduces storage needs, especially for backup systems
        Makes backups more efficient by reducing quantity that needs to be backed up.
    CONS:
        Limited to identical data.
        Requires processing power to identify duplicates.
