Stateful vs Stateless Architecture

Two approaches to managing user information and data processing in software applications, particularly in web services and APIs.

STATEFUL ARCHITECTURE

    Definition: Server retains information (or state) about the client's session. This state is used to remember previous interactions and resopnd in turn to future actions.

    As in, a banking application maintains your session data like authentication which influences how the server responds (displaying account balance, transaction history)

    PROS:   
        Enables more personalized user experience
        Convenient for transactions that require multiple steps
    CONS:
        Resource intensive 
        Scaling a stateful application can be complex due to session data dependencies.

STATELESS ARCHITECTURE

    Definition: Each request from the client to server must contain all information needed to understand and complete the request. RESTful APIs are a classic example of stateless architecture for this reason.

    PROS:
        Simple to implement and scale
        System is more predictable and easier to debug
    CONS:
        Can lead to data redundancy
        Clients may need to handle more complexities in preparing requests
