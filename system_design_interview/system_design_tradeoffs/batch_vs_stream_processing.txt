Batch Processing vs Stream Processing

BATCH PROCESSING 

Large, discrete blocks of data processing. Can be at an interval or when a certain quantity of data is reached. High throughput - efficient for processing large volumes of data where immediate action is not necessary.
    - PROS: Can be more resource efficient as the system can optimize for large volumes of data
            Often simpler to implement and maintain than stream processing.
    - CONS: Delay in insight due to processing delays
            Less flexible in handling changes.

STREAM PROCESSING

Stream processing continuously processes data in real time as it arrives. Ideal for applications requiring instantaneous data processing and decision-making.
    - PROS: More adaptable to changing data and conditions.
    - CONS: Generally more complex to implement
            Resource intensive
