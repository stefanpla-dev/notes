API Gateway vs Direct Service Exposure


API GATEWAY (in this scenario)

Gateway defined in the Load Balancer vs. API Gateway notes section.

    - PROS: Simplifies management of cross-cutting functionality
            Clients need only know the endpoint of the API gateway, not the individual services
            Provides an additional layer of security by offering centralized authentication and SSL termination.

    - CONS: Single point of failure.
            Adding an extra network hop can increase response timelines

DIRECT SERVICE EXPOSURE

Each service is directly exposed to clients. Clients interact with each service through each individual service endpoints. Each service manages its own cross-cutting concerns.
    - PROS: Eliminates a single point of failure
            Requests do not go through an additional layer which can improve latency.
    
    - CONS: Increased complexity for the clients
            Redundant implementations as cross-cutting concerns for each service may need to be implemented.
