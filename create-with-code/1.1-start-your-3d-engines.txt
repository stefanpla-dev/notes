Lesson 1.1: Start Your 3D Engines 

Not much of white to take note in lesson 1.1 - was nice to get a step by step walkthrough of setting up a new project and basic navigation of Unity's interface and be intro'd to a new project. It felt good to reopen it.

I guess I should say that this is only the case because I've used the game engine before so it all seemed familiar, but similar to the time I decided to start over at the 101 German level in college, it was nice to become refamiliarized with the foundations of what makes that technology tick.

Will continue chipping away at it tomorrow.
