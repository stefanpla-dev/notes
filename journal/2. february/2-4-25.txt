I fully forgot to do this yesterday, as I actually had a pretty full day for myself! Brayton's website is coming along decently, I'll be showing him a frankensteined version of it tomorrow early afternoon. Hopefully having something very basic in front of him will jog some thoughts with regards to how he'd like for it to look. Otherwise, I'll keep making decisions and seeing if he's down with them. Which I suppose is a perfectly valid version of web development, if a little more time consuming. Fortunately, I have that in excess at the moment.

Veronica has hooked me up with a few people across Digital Asset to both give me a crash course in Daml and potentially offer some project work. I find the latter difficult to believe given my own dearth of experience, but I suppose I've been surprised before. It would be truly wild if, after so many months of resisting, one of my very first professional connections in this line of work were to eventually lead to paying work. That would make me laugh. After having me feel like an ass for a little bit. 

What else is there? Some Edabit/Hackerrank, some more Unity Learn. I'm talking to Mike and Ray again on Thursday. Last week Mike was oddly quiet, Ray did the lion's share of the talking. I wonder if the roles reverse at some point or another. Curious to see how that dynamic unfolds, which is to say I wasn't necessarily expecting to be three-way-call-attacked the first go around. Having done it, though, I think that format is better. In this context, at least, it felt less confrontational. Nothing compared to the shock and drama of the teen melodrama from which the three-way-call-attack originates.
