Back half of last week wound up being a bit of a wash. I was feeling a little down about this whole thing and gave myself a few days off to regroup.

In that regrouping I figured I must start the udemy course regarding system design tomorrow. I really need that structure again, and it will feel truly righteous to accomplish something like that. Furthermore, it is likely to help me. 

Not much to report in the vein of coding projects. A little bit of development here and there on the LibraryApp with Levi's prodding. I'm getting more and more used to the syntax of Daml which is comforting, especially considering that Veronica is dropping hints that Pinar is likely to offer me a role in some capacity at C7. Which is wild to me. It appears to have sort of just fallen into my lap without much precedence or vetting involved - that said, it is hard to believe I am actually qualified for this sort of thing. I suppose the worst thing that could happen is that I do in fact totally flop and they let me go, only for me to wind up right back where I am now. Which isn't the worst place to be, having effectively "been here" for a while now. 

What will become of my conversations with Mike and Ray should I take a job, I wonder? I have been asked to keep my connection to Veronica/Pinar/Digital Asset/C7 on the DL, so maybe nothing will change. The insight from them is valuable even if I don't have an immediate use for it.
