I introduced an interim step to the conversation with Pinar regarding the role instead of coming right back to her with my ideal responsibilities and salary expectations. This interim step is simply asking for more informaiton - I asked some probing questions about how much runway she thinks she has, whether I should expect to arrange for my own health insurance given the early stage nature of the company, and what the team she has in place that has gotten her this far looks like. Hopefully she comes back to me with something enlightening.

What she doesn't and won't know is that I am in a position in which I practically have to settle for whatever she offers me. I really want to be paid something close to six figures - I never have before, something about that just sounds sexy - but I think that also would reflect the risk that I am taking and the value that I've invested in my own expertise over the last year and change. It would be kind of a shame to come from earning somewhere around $60k to arrive at barely above that after spending that time on a venture almost exclusively intended to bump my salary goals. 

It is difficult to say that this would never happen for me even if that moment isn't now. I can't help but want it to be, though. 

The fact that I would be getting my foot in the door with a crowd that would probably permit me to/ask me to travel, may open up doors to live outside of the country and grant me access to an industry in which everyone is wildly overpaid for what they do is not to be overlooked.

To be continued.
