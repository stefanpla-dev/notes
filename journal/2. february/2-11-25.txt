Web design continues to not be my passion.

As far as Brayton's site goes, I've stylized one of the pages enough to replicate it on others and will kind of copy/paste it all until I can show him next. I'm not really in the mood to do much more artistic direction until he gets his eyes on it. But wow, do I feel like I spent a lot of time coding to produce not a whole hell of a lot. Now that some of the worst is out of the way, though, getting through the rest before showing him again shouldn't take too long. Famous last words.

I worked on some of my Daml homework from Leve today and wrote out a test script for my LibraryBook daml file, and I do feel as if it is very nearly working. So that's nice. This reminds me to follow up with him, I don't believe I've heard back from him regarding another time to speak. 

Now that that's sent..time to sign off. More plugging away tomorrow. Maybe some Unity, for fun.
