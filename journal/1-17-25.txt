More Unity practice today. Getting used to working in that interface, its various quirks. The coding isn't particularly challenging, or at least it hasn't needed to be yet. I suppose it becomes as challenging as I would like for it to be. I do still feel as if this is fun for me, despite the slow progress and occasional true snags that leave me somewhat at a loss for some time. 

Otherwise, though, little else on the horizon. Last week I was roped into going to a bar which I certainly didn't need to attend after getting together at someone's house to watch the week's episode of drag race, and while at said bar someone threw out that they wish someone would build them a personal website. I feel as if I should take them up on this should I see them again this evening. It would be good practice in some of the tech skills I learned at Flatiron that I've barely touched since then, mostly becuase I've come to find that web design is not my passion by any means. The conditions will have to be that 1. he'll design it becuase I don't want to, and 2. that he's alright with me citing it as an example of something I've worked on for professional purposes. I don't think he will mind. 

That would feel like some forward movement in a career changing process that has been slow going, which is not to say that the sorry state of the velocity is somewhat self-inflicted. 

Drew has been here this week which has been a welcome change of pace, but at the same time I definitely feel as if I didn't use my time during the days as efficiently. Some days this week have honestly felt a little empty. No matter, though. Next week we get to try again.
