I am once again getting a slightly later start to my "workday" than I would like, but then again I suppose I owe it to myself to be patient with myself after months of shutting down, both professionally and personally. 

Today I am planning on touching JavaScript for the first time in who even knows how long - all of the practice and projects I've done since last summer have revolved around Python, SQLite, and C# for the Unity Game Engine. It'll be a doozy!

Once I burn out doing practice problems, I'd like to go back to some of my older coding assignments from my Flatiron days and annotate them, run them again, just refamiliarize myself with how the worked and the various parts of them interlocked. Practice problems are good but I need to have multiple ways to ease myself back into the practice besides just problems as hours upon hours of them do get old and I definitely use the time less and less efficiently as that time goes on. 

Next week I'll introduce the Udemy course regarding system design that was recommended to me by another Flatiron alum, and/or the Create with Code track through the Unity Game Engine. If I'm not mistaken, the latter is free. My favorite price. I think that will help keep my practice a little more interesting and dynamic. 

I also have connections abound that I've largely pushed away (see note regarding shutting down above, and in yesterday's entry) that I'll bring back into the fold next week. I need to work up to the courage to talk about how this has been going or, in other words, work up to being vulnerable about the fact that I've often doubted myself, felt as if I have little to offer professionally in this way, and have had difficulty imagining success for myself. Talking about it in a low stakes way can only help me.
