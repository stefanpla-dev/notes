In about an hour I'm headed to my first requirements gathering meeting for Brayton's website. My initial assumptions are that this is to serve as an extension of his resume to showcase projects he's worked on, achievements, etcetera. This time around won't cost a thing becuase I've never done it before and have no idea how to begin estimating how much time this is going to take or even what the quality of the final product will look like, but while I have the luxury of not needing to collect I'm glad to take the pressure off.

I worked through a thorny part of the Create with Code track that had been really irking me, irking me to the point that I had to look away for a few days before looking again. So much of getting the hang of Unity is about navigating the interface, knowing the buttons to press, that sort of thing. The coding know-how is actually relatively simple, especially if you grasp even the basics of object oriented programming. 

Someday I'll reclaim the wackadoodle project I cobbled together to finish up at Flatiron. I wonder if I'd shudder at the house-of-cards that must be holding it all together. Or maybe I'd be a little impressed with myself. Or both.

I'm talking to Mike/Ray on Thursday. It appears as if it'll be a three-way call attack of which I am not sure to make. In the end, now that I've had a few weeks to get back into it, I think my biggest detriment to myself is not my lack of programming prowess but rather the degree to which I haven't been able to talk much. That practice certainly matters too. And who knows, maybe I'll learn a thing or two. They do claim to be professionals, after all.
