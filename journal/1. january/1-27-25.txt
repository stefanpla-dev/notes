Feeling truly busy this week for the first time this year. Wrote myself a note on the list of things I wanted to accomplish today that "everything has to go on the calendar now."

Haha.

Highlights this week include meeting with Brayton (recent friend through another friend) for whom I'll be building a personal website for professional purposes. For free, now, as I haven't done this sort of thing before and don't feel comfortable taking a commission when I have no idea how long it's going to take or what the quality of the output can become. Now that I type this I feel as if I should prepare some leading questions for him regarding the purpose of the site and what he'd like it to do. Design, too. Web design is so not my passion. 

I've also got another call with Veronica on Wednesday, where we will discuss...I'm not sure! Ha. I've done some initial research on Trading Technologies, a Chicago based firm that she threw out on one of our calls last week. I'm not sure if she's prepared to make intros there, but I honestly don't care all that much. It was nice to have a way to direct my research and time. I have some questions for her about it. We'll go from there. Can't help but hope she was musing correctly when she mentioned that they've got a company in their portfolio that deals in gaming. Again, not after a specific job, but just to talk to someone about what that work is like would be really eye-opening. 

Create with Code taking a backseat because of all of this. Doesn't mean it's over, though.
