Didn't sit at ye olde computer yesterday. I guess that's going to have to be ok. Today I moved through a few Unity tutorials, took a few of their quizzes (passed! wooo) and got some notes and questions together for my chat with Veronica tomorrow. Veronica is a colleague of sorts of my dad's, they're working together on a project for which my dad has clearly signed an NDA because he won't talk about it. Hate NDA culture. 

This will, quite literally, be my first meaningful discussion with a professional in some time. Months. I shouldn't be nervous about it since she seems lovely and the states are zero, but nevertheless I am. I am anxious to see what becomes of it. If I'll falter at all, or if the words will kind of just come out of me. Always hard to say which. Will have to significantly caffeinate beforehand for optimal performance. 

What am I trying to get out of this? Mostly, the practice getting my own talk on. I have to walk in remembering that the game development bend is what got me intrigued, my colleagues at Column inspired me to take the same path, and my learnings from Flatiron are ultimately what kept me engaged. I would like to walk away from this conversation with permission to continue to contact Veronica on a semi-regular basis to check in, chat, or whatever depending on how it all goes. It would also be lovely to be put in touch with some other colleagues of hers who wouldn't mind speaking with a nascent developer, maybe someone who is such a total dork about what they do that they'd be glad to talk to a wall about it. 

I feel as if this is the beginning of a completely new part of the job search process that I have needed to kickstart for some time. Here's to finally doing so.
