Energizing day. Veronica offered to set me up with someone who will give me a crash course in Daml. I graciously accepted. She doesn't feel as if C++ is the future. In fact, she referred to it as a dinosaur. I laughed. 

I'm now juggling a few projects at once and it feels good. I think this will become my preferred state. Those projects are:

1. Working on Daml basics. This progress is slow but relatively enjoyable. The language is declarative and the syntax uncomplicated. 

2. Working on Brayton's personal site. I'll chip away at it a little bit each day.

3. Create with Code via Unity Learn. I've already made it at least a third of the way through, so it would be good of me to see it to completion. 

4. This hasn't yet started, but the system design course recommended to me by another Flatiron alum and vetted by Veronica will be a good use of my time. It has been floating in the back of my mind for some time and would serve as a good foundation for any system I may or may not create in the future. 

Despite this, I do find myself occasionally running out of steam throughout the day. In these moments I think I should be honest with myself and walk away for a little bit, but having something concrete to walk to with a finite beginning and end to limit the time away while still giving myself a break will be a worthwhile search. For now, it continues.
