Had a call with Mike and Ray today where they kind of just let me gab. It left me feeling good, and I was impressed that they were able to identify a lot of the insecurities about the job search almost immediately. Those, namely, are that I feel as if a lot of the steps of my career thus far have happened to me as opposed to me choosing them. I certainly feel as if I have lost, or maybe never really had, a sense of agency in my choices professionally. I think there is work to be done to confront the fact that I lack a certain confidence to professionally seek out what I want and deserve which has left me feeling challenged when it comes to articulating what it is that I want or feel like I deserve. I hope they can help me. 

Otherwise, I made half-decent progress on Brayton's site today and will likely spend the reset of the workday on Unity. I am going to try to keep pretty careful track of how long building this site takes me, including the work that goes into getting it "live" so I can provide a quote should there be subsequent opportunities for which I can actually earn some cash. So far, I've created a basic structure for the website and filled it with basically nothing and some simple styling to separate the different sections of the site (header from navigation bar from layout body from footer), all of which has taken about two hours. If I had to guess, the total time for the site will be about twenty hours. But we shall see. It somewhat depends on how detailed Brayton wants to get in terms of styling.

Tomorrow I'll move my setup downstairs seeing as Drew will be here and, as the one with the real job, will be utilizing the office room. Last time around I wasn't nearly as productive downstairs but I also wasn't doing nearly as good of a job measuring my own progress and output so maybe this time will be different.
