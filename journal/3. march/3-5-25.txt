Good progress on Brayton's site today. I feel as if him and I are converging on something that he might actually like, or at least I'm beginning to see his vision a little more now that we've been working together on this for some time. Maybe I'll even feel good enough about it to cite it professionally. We'll see about that much, though. 

Otherwise, besides a little progress on the system design course, not much else to report. Tomorrow and Friday will be largely dedicated to system design seeing as I don't have much else on my schedule coding-wise or professionally. I think the strategy is going to be to first get everything down in my notes, and then go back and study from the notes for the purposes of taking the quizzes/tests that the course contains. The sooner I can be off of the site, the better.

Still no word from Pinar regarding the potential job. It is beginning to give me a lackluster taste in my mouth. That said, this has given me additional time to research and consult with the people in my life who have meaningful opinions to provide on this matter. So we'll see. I am far from having written it off.
