Call with Levi this morning. I think he's warming up to me a bit. Or, warming up to the fact that he is the Lord God King Authority when it comes to know-how regarding Daml, whose expertise is within the realm of my own imagination but barely so. Just gotta do a little something every day.

I've allowed myself to get distracted many a time which has taken away from making a meaningful dent in the System Design course I purchased, but I'd like to have that done before I start working with Pinar, if that is even to go that way. I imagine a hard and fast start date would be awfully motivating. 

Speaking of working with Pinar, I'm going to chat with Leo sometime this week regarding the early Column days so I can begin the negotiating process with a little more information. Still feel as if this one will be a doozy. I just hope it's the good kind. 

Feeling a little fried Daml-wise after today's call and work, so tomorrow will be split between System Design and a few tweaks to Brayton's site. And then we will go from there.
