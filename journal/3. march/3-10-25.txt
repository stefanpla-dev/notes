Wow has a stint of really nice weather distracted me. After having lived through the past few months of icy winter in the midwest, a cold unlike anything I've experienced in years, I feel as if I have earned it. 

This week will be filled by additional work on the system design course - I'd like to continue making some good headway. An ambitious goal would be to have it 50% complete by the end of the week. Putting it out there to my audience of no one to see if that gives me enough lift to make it happen. 

Otherwise, my call with Levi this morning equipped me with good ammo to continue to instruct myself regarding Daml. That studying will continue as well. I am thinking that I should take myself to another location in order to effectively study as being at home is rather distracting. Will start scoping those out this week as well. 

May get back into some data structure/algos work with Edabit et al. This week it's looking like I will have the time.
