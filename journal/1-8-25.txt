I woke up feeling anxious this morning, feeling like it was hard to look away from everything I have to accomplish in order to make this a sustainable line of work for myself. I maintain this gut feeling I have that this is right - the software engineers in the room always seemed like the smartest people and that intrigued me, I wanted to be close to them, but also that this is a language learning exercise, and I've had the opportunity to both by choice and by necessity learn languages and do it well before in my life. 

Still, the mountain is a big one. Or at least, it appears to be a big one. Perhaps the most damaging part of the last few months was the degree to which I isolated myself, not just personally but also professionally. So long as I consistently chip away at it every day (so far so good), I do not feel badly about taking this first week or two to dust off the worst of the cobwebs coding-wise on my own, but then I have to find a way to get my talk on with other people. I just might find that there are ways to climb this mountain that I hadn't yet considered, or I might be woken up to new opportunities or ways to stay sharp that I wouldn't have discovered on my own. 

In addition to my coding practice today I would like to investigate the Fiverr/Upwork cinematic universe as a way to make a little bit of cash and gain some experience while I navigate finding full-time work. It would be great to get some kind of gig coding for the hell of it, but I would also be open to editing and revising writing. That's something I've always enjoyed and really excelled at. I think it would feel good to get back into the groove of something tha feels good and familiar. It might boost my confidence and encourage me to feel as if I do have something to offer professionally which, after a few months of more or less shutting down, has been hard to believe. 

Anyway - onward. HackerRank awaits.
